# Substitution Ciphers Playground

These are some visualizations I built for showing how the substitution ciphers Rot13, Caesar and Vigenere work.

In order to run locally, you can clone this and run:

`npm install`

`gulp`

This should build the source files and open a browser window with the results.

Coffee-jade template used was this:
